# ToxicTextClassification

In this session, we explore using multiple classification algorithms to predict if a if a users' comment is toxic or not.

### Software, Tools, and prerequisits

1. Access to Jupyter Notebook.
2. Basic python programing.
3. Basic knowledge of uning third-party packages.

### Steps to completing the project

1. Import the necessary modules/ packages needed for this project.
2. Generate your dataset and clean them/ prepare them as necessary.
3. Visualize your dataset using the Seaborn package.
4. Create your tokenizer to remove unecessary words and characters.
5. Vectorize the dataset using both the CountVectorizer and the TfidVectorizer.
6. Split into training and test sets.
7. Implement the the various Algorithms for this. For details on each classifer, visit the dedicated repo:
   - [Logistic regression](https://github.com/ccibeekeoc42/Basic_Logistic_Regression).
   - [K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/ccibeekeoc42/Basic_KNN).
   - Random Forest.
   - Naive Bayes.
   - Decision Tree.
8. Compare the accuracy of all 4 methods. In this case, Naive Bayes performed the best.
